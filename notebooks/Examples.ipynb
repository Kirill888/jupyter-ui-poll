It also gives you mechanisms to maintain interactivity of widgets while executing a long-running cell.\n",

    "Example of using `ui_events` function. This is the foundational function in `jupyter-ui-poll` library, all other methods use it under the hood. `ui_events` returns a function your code should call to process UI events that happened so far while executing a long-running cell. This requires temporarily modifying internals of the running IPython kernel, hence this function needs to be used inside `with` statement, so that IPython state can be restored to normal once your code is done, even if errors have happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can supply how many events should be processed everytime you call `ui_poll` function, default is `1`. You probably want to use larger value if you have highly interactve widgets that generate a lot of events, like a map, or if your poll frequency is low. One should aim for something like 100 events per second. If you notice that UI lags and is not responsive try increasing poll frequency and if that is not possible, increase number of UI events you process per polling interval.\n",
